"""Rule expert E5: key, estimated two ways and cross-checked.

Way one listens to the whole piece: the average chroma is correlated with
the Krumhansl-Schmuckler key profiles. Way two reads the chord sheet: each
candidate key is scored by how much of the chord sequence (by duration) it
explains. A transcriber does both ("the song sits on G, and these chords are
the ones G major has"), and when the two disagree the key is doubtful.

Key index convention: tonic * 2 + (0 for major, 1 for minor).

The chord view is scored in overlapping windows and averaged, so a piece
that modulates (or whose model output drifts) votes window by window
instead of pooling two keys into a third one. A relative major/minor pair
that scores within RELATIVE_MARGIN is settled by which tonic chord gets
more time, with the opening and closing chords (tonic, or its dominant)
as extra votes: those are what a listener uses to tell C major from A
minor. The weights were chosen on GuitarSet's tuning half with
scripts/eval_key_inputs.py (docs/plans/step-2.md, 2.7).
