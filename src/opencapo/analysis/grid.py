"""Turn beat and downbeat times into the Beat grid, global tempo and meter.

Pure computation on top of a beat tracker's output; no model code here.
Rules (docs/plans/step-1.md, section 2.3):

- beats per bar `n` is the mode of the beat count between consecutive downbeats;
- bars are numbered from the earliest one; beats before the first downbeat are
  put into implicit bars of `n` beats so that `bar_index` starts at 0;
- a bar that the tracker gave more than `n` beats keeps counting (a missed
  downbeat is reported as is, not repaired);
- fewer than two downbeats, or every beat flagged as one, means the bar length
  is unknown: bars of DEFAULT_BEATS_PER_BAR are laid out and no meter is claimed;
- bpm is 60 over the median beat interval;
- the meter is n/4, except that six beats per bar is written 6/8.
