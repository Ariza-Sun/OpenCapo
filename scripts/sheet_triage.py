"""Sort the owner's downloaded sheet images into one ordered page set per song.

Usage:
    python scripts/sheet_triage.py RAW_DIR --out DIR [--apply]

RAW_DIR holds one folder per song (pages as images or a PDF; duplicates,
second versions and stray files are tolerated) and possibly loose files
at the top. Without --apply only DIR/triage.md and DIR/triage.json are
written: one row per song saying which files were taken as its pages, in
what order, how sure the order is, the capo found in a file name, and
what was left out. --review FILE brings in what an agent saw on the
pages (the reading order with its evidence, the sheet's maker, whether
there is a numbered-notation line, the printed header), which settles
the guessed orders. With --apply the chosen pages are also written as
DIR/<name>/p01.png ... so `scripts/sheet_ocr.py read DIR/<name>` reads
the song. Nothing here reads a sheet; the table is for a person to check.
